<h2 align="center">:rocket: About Me</h2>

I’m Ian Benlolo, a Machine Learning Engineer at Updata where I build scalable ML and optimization solutions that solve real-world problems across industries. I have a foundation in both machine learning and physics, grounded in my academic experience and apply it to industry. See [updata](https://updata.ca/en/home/) to learn more about us, we do cool stuff.


Before joining Updata, I worked in research at the CLEAN Lab (at the University of Ottawa), focusing on accelerating materials design and contributing to work on neural network training techniques using monte-carlo based learning algorithms. 
[Clean Energy Science](https://clean.energyscience.ca/). 

I enjoy designing and optimizing data pipelines, building robust ML systems, and exploring the intersection of physics, computational modeling, and machine learning. Outside of formal projects, I tinker with automation scripts, and open-source code that makes everyday workflows smoother. I'm currently working on an AI travelling app. Please reach out to learn more :smile:. 

**Outside of my laptop**, I seek out new coffee shops and restaurants (big foodie here :sushi:). I'm an amateur (but avid!) tennis player, weight lifter and an aspiring steak master. As a physicist it is also my duty to tell you I go rock climbing and (unfortunately) sometimes running.
